# Variational-Autoencoder-for-High-Redshift-Galaxies
I implemented a Variational Autoencoder on JWST NirCam data for high-redshift galaxies (z>2), which is accessible through the DJA website. To test the architecture I developed, I also applied it to nearby galaxy data (0.0005 &lt; z &lt; 0.25) from SDSS.
